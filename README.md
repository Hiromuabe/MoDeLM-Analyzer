# MoDeLM-Analyzer

# Notes for Reviewers

This repository has been prepared as a **review repository for LREC**.

- The `models` directory contains the pretrained SAE weights.  
- Please run `main.ipynb` to reproduce the results.  
- The required libraries are listed in `requirements.txt`.  
- This method requires access to the **OpenAI API**.  

Since **GPT-2** and **SAE** are used as encoding methods, we recommend running in a **GPU environment**.

> **Note:** For readability reasons, the outputs may differ slightly from the figures shown in the paper.
